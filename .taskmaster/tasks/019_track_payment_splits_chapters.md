# Task 19: Track Payment Splits to Chapters

## Summary
Implemented improvements to ensure payment splits are properly tracked and associated with chapters/tracks being played.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Chapter-to-Split Matching Algorithm
- **File**: `src/services/ValueTimeSplitService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `matchValueTimeSplitsWithChapters()` to use actual chapter end times instead of fixed 5-minute duration
  - Added comprehensive overlap detection that handles:
    - Splits starting within chapter
    - Splits ending within chapter
    - Splits encompassing entire chapter
    - Splits without duration (point-in-time splits)
  - Added new `getSplitsForTimeRange()` method for more flexible time-based matching

### 2. Updated Component Logic
- **File**: `src/components/EpisodeDetailPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated both Track Listing and Chapters sections to use improved matching logic
  - Replaced simple start-time checking with comprehensive overlap detection
  - Added visual indicator when tracks don't have payment splits configured
  - Shows "ℹ️ No payment splits configured for this track" message

### 3. Added Validation Method
- **File**: `src/services/ValueTimeSplitService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `validateChapterPaymentCoverage()` method to analyze payment coverage
  - Returns statistics including:
    - Total chapters count
    - Chapters with payment splits
    - List of chapters without payment
    - Coverage percentage

## Technical Details

### Improved Matching Logic
```typescript
// Old logic (only checked start time):
split.startTime >= track.startTime && split.startTime < trackEndTime

// New logic (comprehensive overlap detection):
getSplitsForTimeRange(splits, startTime, endTime)
```

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Splits without duration**: Treated as point-in-time events
2. **Last chapter**: Uses Infinity as end time to catch all remaining splits
3. **Overlapping splits**: Properly detected when splits span multiple chapters
4. **Missing payment info**: Visual feedback for tracks without configured splits

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with episodes containing multiple tracks with different payment configurations
2. Verify splits that span multiple chapters are properly associated
3. Check edge cases like very short chapters or splits
4. Ensure visual indicators appear for tracks without payment info
5. Test with various podcast feeds to ensure compatibility

## Result
Payment splits are now more accurately tracked and associated with the specific chapters/tracks being played, ensuring artists receive proper attribution for their content.
