# Task 3: Implement CORS Proxy and Feed Access

## Priority: Medium
## Estimated Time: 3-4 hours
## Dependencies: Task 1

## Description
Implement a CORS proxy solution to handle cross-origin requests for RSS feeds that don't have proper CORS headers, ensuring the application can validate feeds from any source.

## Requirements
- **FR1.4**: Handle CORS issues with proxy support
- **SR1.2**: Implement proper CORS handling
- **TR1.1**: Load and parse feeds within 5 seconds

## Current State
The application currently makes direct requests to RSS feeds, which may fail due to CORS restrictions when feeds don't include proper CORS headers.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CORS Proxy Service
- Create `src/services/CorsProxyService.ts`
- Implement fallback proxy logic for CORS-restricted feeds
- Add multiple proxy endpoints for redundancy
- Handle proxy failures gracefully

### 2. Feed Request Manager
- Create `src/services/FeedRequestManager.ts`
- Implement smart request strategy (direct first, proxy fallback)
- Add request timeout handling
- Implement retry logic for failed requests

### 3. Error Handling and User Feedback
- Provide clear feedback when CORS issues occur
- Explain proxy usage to users
- Show request status and progress
- Handle various network error scenarios

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Implement request caching for recently accessed feeds
- Add request queuing for multiple concurrent requests
- Optimize proxy selection based on performance

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Successfully fetch feeds that have CORS restrictions
2. Provide clear feedback about proxy usage
3. Handle proxy failures gracefully with fallback options
4. Maintain performance within 5-second limit
5. Cache successful requests to improve performance

## Technical Notes
- Use public CORS proxies as fallback (e.g., cors-anywhere, allorigins)
- Consider implementing a simple proxy server for production use
- Implement proper error handling for network timeouts
- Add request logging for debugging purposes

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/services/CorsProxyService.ts` (new)
- `src/services/FeedRequestManager.ts` (new)
- `src/types/network.ts` (new)
- `src/components/RSSFeedChecker.tsx` (modify)
- `src/components/NetworkStatus.tsx` (new)

## Security Considerations
- Validate all proxy responses
- Implement rate limiting for proxy requests
- Sanitize URLs before proxy requests
- Monitor for malicious proxy responses
